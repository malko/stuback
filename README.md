# stuback

proxy server to ease api development

## installation:
```
npm install -g stuback
```

launch the server like this
```
stuback -p 3000 -c config.js -s ./stubs
```

See sample config file for now for more info about configuration.
The config file will be watched for changes so you can edit without reloading the server.

## How to work with stuback?

### Sample configuration file explained:
Configuration files can be either a commonjs module like the one below, or a json file. The _.js_ or _.json_ extensions are required.
Stuback watch the configuration file for changes so it will be automatically read on save. If you didn't give him a configuration file it will create one for you in $USERDIR/.stuback.json

Here's a commented sample configuration file:
```javascrip
module.exports = {
	/**********************************************************************************
	* Each host has it's own "hostConfig" section.                                    *
	* The key must match the received reqest hostname.                                *
	* **/!\** when requesting your local machine the request will have a              *
	*         _null_ hostname, _stuback_ will then lookup for a _localhost_ config.   *
	**********************************************************************************/
	localhost: {

		// Optional server to redirect request to
		//(useful when stuback is used as a system or browser proxy)
		targetHost: 'mydevelopmentserver.net',

		// Optional port to redirect request to
		targetPort: '8080',

		// When true stuback will try to proxy any request which doesn't match defined
		// paths in stubbed or backed.
		// If false you will get an error on not stubbed or backed urls.
		// You probably want true for a system defined proxy and probably in most cases
		passthrough: true,

		// default proxyied request doesn't timeout. You can set a timeout on a by host basis.
		timeout: 5000,

		/***************************************************************************

			// they will be looked up in order they are defined.
			'/api/doc.html': true, // boolean value can be used as a shortcut for {use: true}

			'/api/*': {
				// True if ommited, tell stuback whether this path should be used

				// a path from the config without removing the it from the file.
				use: true,

				// You can defined specific response headers for a given path.
				// They will be applied after hostConfig.responseHeaders and hostConfig.stubs.responseHeaders settings
				// Any falsy value will result in header removal.
				responseHeaders: {
					// add a Content-Type header
					'Content-Type': 'application/vnd.myapimediatype+json',
					// remove any WWW-Authenticate header
					'WWW-Authenticate': false
				},

				// Optionally you can force a particular response statusCode for a given path
				statusCode: 500

				// don't include this, it's just here to tell you that it's a reserved name
				exp: undefined
			},

			// You can defined specific response headers for all stubbed paths at once.
			// They will be applied after hostConfig.responseHeaders settings and
			// before hostConfig.stubs.path.responseHeaders.
			// Falsy values will result in header removal.
			responseHeaders: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
		},

### system or browser proxy:
You can use Proxy Automatic Configuration by setting your system or browser automatic proxy settings to ```http://127.0.0.1:3000/proxy.pac``` (change port accodingly to your settings).

This method require no modification to your application code and is quick to set in place.
The bad part is you will have to reset your proxy settings everytime you change your configuration file (changing stubs, backed or tampered may work without changing your settings).
This is the prefered method when working on a remote host with no access to the code or when the code use the endpoint to call at multiple place in your code.


### direct server call:
You can direct your application api calls to localhost or any other address your proxy will respond on and use targetHost and targetPort settings like in sample configuration above.
This has the advantage of not modifying your browser or system proxy settings and so you won't have to reset them on configuration change.
The bad part is you need to modify your code base to direct request to the proxy instead.
This method is prefered when your application can use different hosts depending on env or application settings for example.


### Where to put my stubs
stubs will be organised and looked-up in the following way:
```
/stubs
	|_ hostname
	 	|_ [lowercase_http_verb]-encodeURIComponent(pathUrl)-md5(parameters)
```
use the --verbose option to see which files stuback is trying to reach, so you can easily copy/paste names to create new stubs files.

### Access to the admin section:
You can access the admin section pointing to http://localhost:3000/stuback/admin

## This is for the DEV
Stuback is in no way intended to be used for anything else than development.
I use stuback for my daily needs and i'll be happy if it can help you in your job. As always, feature request, contributions(code, documentation or logo) and bug reporting are more than welcome.
